# mol_dock
This repository contains a complete workflow for performing molecular docking studies to predict the interaction between small molecules (ligands) and target proteins. Molecular docking is a computational technique used in structure-based drug design to estimate the binding affinity and orientation of a ligand within the binding site of a protein.
📌 Key Features:
Protein and ligand preparation

Docking using tools like AutoDock Vina / PyRx / CB-Dock

Visualization of binding poses

Analysis of binding affinity and interaction residues

🛠️ Tools Used:
AutoDock Vina / PyRx / Chimera / Open Babel

Python / Shell scripts for automation

Discovery Studio or PyMOL for visualization

📁 Contents:
/data – Protein and ligand structure files (.pdb, .mol2)

/scripts – Preprocessing and docking scripts

/results – Docking output files and interaction data

/notebooks – Optional Jupyter notebooks for analysis

📖 How to Use:
Clone the repository

Prepare your protein and ligand

Run the docking script or tool

Analyze binding poses and scores

🔬 Applications:
Drug discovery

Lead compound screening

Structure-based virtual screening
