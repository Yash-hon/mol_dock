# mol_dock
This repository contains a complete workflow for performing molecular docking studies to predict the interaction between small molecules (ligands) and target proteins. Molecular docking is a computational technique used in structure-based drug design to estimate the binding affinity and orientation of a ligand within the binding site of a protein.
